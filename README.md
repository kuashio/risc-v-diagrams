# RISC-V Diagrams
This is a series of illustrations of RISC-V base instruction sets and extensions. I created the first illustration when I needed one for a technical article, and found no such thing online.

The provided files are in the Inkscape SVG format. Feel free to use and edit them under the license specified below.

# Requests
Yeah, I take requests for RISC-V ISA variants like RV32G, RV32EMC, etc. You can reach me by email: kuashio@gmail.com
